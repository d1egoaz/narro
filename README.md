## API Key Setup

After installing Narro, you'll need an OpenAI API key:

- **OpenAI**: [Get your API key here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

**Requirements:**
- **macOS 14.0+** (Apple Silicon & Intel supported)
- **OpenAI API key** (supports multiple models: whisper-1, gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o-mini-transcribe)

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Transcription
1. **Select Model**: Pick from whisper-1, gpt-4o-transcribe, or gpt-4o-mini-transcribe
2. **Enter API Key**: Paste your OpenAI API key in the secure field
3. **Start Recording**: Press the global hotkey (default: ‚åò‚áß;) and speak
4. **View Results**: See real-time transcription inserted into the application you're using
5. **(Optional) Copy**: Use buttons to copy the transcript

### Advanced Features

#### Microphone Priority Management
- **View Available Devices**: See all connected microphones with system default indicators
- **Set Priority Order**: Add devices to priority list with + buttons
- **Automatic Fallback**: App automatically uses highest-priority available device
- **Real-time Switching**: Seamlessly switches when preferred devices connect/disconnect
- **Remove from Priority**: Use ‚àí buttons to remove devices from priority list

#### Custom System Prompts
- Add context-specific prompts to improve transcription accuracy
- Examples: "Medical terminology", "Technical jargon", "Names: John, Sarah, Mike"
- Prompts help the AI better understand domain-specific language

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No audio storage**: Audio is processed in real-time, never stored locally
- **API keys are safe**: Keys are stored in Keychain
- **TLS encryption**: All API communication uses HTTPS
- **Microphone permission**: Explicit user consent required for audio access

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Microphone Permission Denied**: Check System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone
- **No Microphones Found**: Click "Refresh" in the Microphone Priority section
- **Wrong Microphone Active**: Set your preferred priority order or check device connections
- **App Not Responding to Hotkey**: Ensure accessibility permissions are granted when prompted

## üë©‚Äçüíª Development

*This section is for developers who want to build Narro from source or contribute to the project.*

### Development Requirements
- **macOS 14.0+** (Apple Silicon & Intel supported)
- **Xcode 15+** for building
- **OpenAI API key** for testing

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/d1egoaz/narro.git
cd narro
```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
```bash
open NarroApp.xcodeproj
```

3. **Build and run:**
   - In Xcode, select the **NarroApp** scheme
   - Build and run with **‚åòR**
   - Grant microphone permission when prompted

#### Command Line Building

```bash
# Build via command line
xcodebuild -project NarroApp.xcodeproj -scheme NarroApp build
```

### Architecture

Narro follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **CaptureEngine**: Handles audio capture using AVAudioEngine with Core Audio device management
- **DeviceManager**: Manages microphone priority lists and automatic device selection
- **TranscriptionService**: Orchestrates streaming transcription with provider abstraction
- **STTProvider Protocol**: Clean interface allowing easy addition of new providers
- **Modern SwiftUI**: Reactive UI with proper state management and real-time updates

### Testing

Currently, Narro includes manual testing capabilities through the built-in Text Injection Test Suite accessible from the app's interface. This allows you to test text insertion functionality across different applications.

Automated unit tests are planned for future releases.

### Development Troubleshooting

#### Accessibility Permissions (Development)
- **Permission Not Updating**: During development/testing, when the app changes (rebuild, code changes), macOS treats it as a "new" app
- **Solution**: Remove the old app entry from System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility, then re-grant permission
- **Why This Happens**: Each build gets a different signature, so macOS sees it as a different application
- **Quick Fix**: Check the app list in Accessibility settings and remove any old/duplicate Narro entries

#### Testing Onboarding Flow
- **Reset App State**: To test the complete onboarding flow, change the `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in Xcode project settings
- **Why This Works**: Changing the bundle identifier creates a "new" app from macOS perspective, resetting all permissions and app state
- **Most Reliable Method**: This is more reliable than clearing UserDefaults and ensures a clean onboarding test including all system permissions
